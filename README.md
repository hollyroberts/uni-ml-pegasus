# uni-ml-pegasus

A Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) is used to encode multiple categories of the CIFAR-10 dataset. We then attempt to interpolate between them to create a pegasus (with varying levels of success).
A more detailed description can be read in part 2 of the ![report](https://github.com/BlackenedGem/uni-ml-classifier/blob/master/ML%20Report.pdf).
